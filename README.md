##MySQL is an object-relational database management system. It is a popular low-maintenance database and is available in various flavors and editions, 
including a clustered version for demanding workloads. Itâ€™s available to use in a range of ways to suit your needs. You can download and install the free Community Edition
under a GNU General Public License and you can embed this in your own applications. Alternatively, you can purchase, download, and install commercial editions, 
such as Standard, Enterprise, and Cluster versions, which include additional functionality. MySQL is also available in the cloud. You can self-manage in virtual machine 
images or containers or you can use a managed service such as IBM Cloud, Amazon RDS for MySQL, Azure Database for MySQL, or Google Cloud SQL for MySQL. There is a range
of tools that you can use to work with your databases, including the mysql command line interface, 
the MySQL Workbench desktop application for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS versions of MySQL, and the popular third-party web interface, phpMyAdmin.
